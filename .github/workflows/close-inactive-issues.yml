            Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

            We're working to clean up our issue tracker by closing older issues that might not be relevant anymore. If you are able to reproduce this issue in the latest version of Acode, please let us know by commenting on this issue(i.e Bump!), and we will keep it open. If you can't reproduce it, feel free to close the issue yourself. Otherwise, we'll close it in 14 days.

            Thanks for your help!
